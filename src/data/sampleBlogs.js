    title: "Is Lung Cancer Just Smoker’s Disease: Know the Risks and How to Protect Your Lungs",
    description: String.raw`
When most people hear the word “lung cancer”, they instantly think of smoking. But here’s the surprising truth — more and more cases are being found in people who have never touched a cigarette.

Yes, smoking is still a major culprit, but it’s not the only one. Secondhand smoke, polluted air, fumes from indoor cooking, invisible radon gas, and hazardous substances like asbestos or diesel exhaust can quietly put your lungs at risk too. Lung cancer isn’t always about your choices — sometimes, it’s about your surroundings.

## Lung Cancer: Risk Factors Beyond Smoking
When it comes to lung cancer, smoking is the usual suspect — but it’s far from the only danger. Other risk factors include:

- Secondhand Smoke
- Air Pollution
- Radon Gas
- Chemical Exposure
- Indoor Cooking Smoke
- Genetics and Family History

## How to Protect Your Lungs
- Avoid tobacco and secondhand smoke
- Limit exposure to air pollutants
- Maintain a healthy lifestyle
- Get screened if at risk

### In Conclusion
Lung cancer isn’t just a smoker’s disease — it’s a condition that can affect anyone.
